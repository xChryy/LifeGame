# LifeGame

LifeGame is an implementation of John Conway's famous "Game of Life," a cellular automaton that simulates the evolution of a population of cells on a two-dimensional grid according to simple mathematical rules.

## Description

This project allows you to visualize and interact with the Game of Life simulation. Each cell on the grid can be either alive or dead, and their state evolves over time based on the following rules:

1. A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives.
2. A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive.
3. In all other cases, the cell dies or remains dead.

## Features

- **Grid visualization**: Displays the current state of the cells.
- **Automatic evolution**: The simulation advances automatically at each time tick.
- **Initial configurations**: Load predefined patterns (Glider, Oscillator, etc.).

## Requirements

- [Programming language used] (C)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/0xChryy/LifeGame.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```
    cd LifeGame
    ```
3. Compile the file:
    make
    ```
4. Run the program:
    ```
    [./lifegame]
    ```

## Usage

- Start the simulation to see the evolution of the cells.
